__Data Understanding and Analysis__

__Source of Data__
To make this analysis a success, I used the im.db data set as well as the bom.movie_gross.csv,gross.From the 'im.db' I used tow specific tables which are 'movie_basics' and 'movie_rating'. The two tables contain different data such as the movie names, genres, runtime, release dates, average ratings of each movie, number of votes that led to the average rating etc. The 'bom.movies_gross.csv.gz' file is a csv that contains a list of movies and the income they have generated both domestically and in the foreign set up

__Summary Of Conclusion and Relevant Findings__
There are many factors that affect the success of a movie. Our analysis covers some of the factors to enable Microsoft Studio to understand the best way to venture into the movie industry.

Genres Analysis
From the genre analysis, we saw that there is a vast distribution of movies across different genres. However, the goal was to understand which genre has the most movie productions in them. This is because we need to find the popular genres in order to suggest the best genres to suggest to Microsoft Studio. The top ten genres show that they have high movie production 2. Rating and Votes Analysis We went ahead to figure out the relationship between the average ratings and total number of votes across each genre. From our analysis we note a certain trend which is, the movies with the highest number of votes are just above average in the average ratings, while the movies with the minimal votes have the highest votes... This is to say that the audience reception of the movies in the great, the engagement is high and it would be a great idea to make movie productions that are in line with the top ten most popular genres. This will give the company high audience engagement that equals high income 3. Domestic and Foreign Income Analysis From this analysis we have seen that the most Domestic income generating genre is the 'Horror' while the genre that generates the most foreign income is the 'Comedy, Romance'; this is from the top ten most popular genres

Given the above Analysis Factors I would recomend the following;

Microsoft studio should choose the following genres 'Horror' , 'Comedy,Drama', 'Documentary', 'Drama, Romance' and 'Thriller'
Choosing these genres will ensure that the company makes great returns both in audience reception and income
From my analysis, I would advice the company stakeholers to invest more money in the production of movies to ensure that the audience engagement is at its best, we would like to have more views of our movies as well as high rates
